# Discord Zed Extension

Integrates Zed with Discord.

If you're asking **"why should I use this instead of the
[existing Discord Zed extension]?"**, the answer is: ***don't.*** I'm kind of a
dummy and didn't even realize it existed until about halfway through making
this, but I didn't throw this away because I thought this was cool and I wanted to
keep working on it anyway.

The extension itself is pretty light, [Discord LS] is where the meat is at. I
would recommend checking that out.
